      <p>
        There are only three things I have strong feelings about in this world
        and they are: peanut butter, anime, and dogs. I love all three in equal
        measure.

      <h2>Peanut Butter</h2>
      <div class="grid-row">
        <!-- Paragraph -->
        <p>
          My favorite food is peanut butter. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,
          peanut butter cookies, peanut butter fudge—I love them all. I like it
          because of its sweet taste and versatility. In my opinion, smooth
          peanut butter is the best…even if I don&rsquo;t always have the best
          luck opening the jar…

      <h2>Anime</h2>
      <!-- Section -->
      <section>
        <p>
          Anime refers to Japanese animated productions that are often
          characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters, and intricate
          storylines. Anime covers a wide range of genres, including action,
          romance, comedy, and drama, and is enjoyed by people of all ages
          around the world. Many anime series have gained a devoted following,
          and the medium has become an important part of popular culture in many
          countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up watching Inu Yasha, Dragon Ball, and Naruto, but these days
          I tend to like (unfortunately) shorter anime like Chainsaw Man and One
          Punch Man. However, one of my favorite characters of all time is from
          Naruto. His name is Uchiha Madara.

      <h2>Dogs</h2>
      <!-- Section -->
      <section>
        <p>
          Needless to say, I&rsquo;m a dog person. I have only ever had one dog
          in my life, but she was my best friend while I had her and my memories
          of her remain precious to this day. You can learn more about my
          friend, Tiffany, in
          <a href="family.html">Family</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, I like dogs because of their loyalty, affection, and
          playfulness. I prefer big dogs, because they don&rsquo;t generally
          bark as much as small dogs do, and they&rsquo;re usually more calm.
          That said, the one downside is that I can&rsquo;t easily pick up big
          dogs and I like that aspect in small dogs.
