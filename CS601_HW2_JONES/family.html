        I'd like to introduce you to my furry friend, Tiffany. She was a lovable
        sixteen-year-old Pekingese who had been a cherished member of my family
        for many years. Despite her small size, she had a big personality and
        loved to play and cuddle. As she got older, she developed a few health
        issues, but she was still full of energy and always managed to put a
        smile on my face. Tiffany was a loyal companion and a source of comfort
        for me, and I feel lucky to have had her in my life.
